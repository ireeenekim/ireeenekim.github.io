                        I found the idea that mail serves as the support rather than the medium of mail art especially interesting. At first, I was more focused on the “mail” itself, but the author’s examples—like a gift where delivery is central versus a bank letter where content is more central—helped clarify his distinction between “mail” vs. “art” and helped me better understand how mail operates within the framework of mail art. After reading the whole piece, it also made me reflect on how the internet can both expand and disrupt mail art, altering its tangible and experiential qualities.

                        What stood out to me in Schwulst’s piece was how she describes websites with metaphors like houses, gardens, or even puddles. It made me think about the internet as something alive and constantly changing, instead of just a polished portfolio or a social media feed. Édouard takes a similar approach with reading, showing how meaning grows when we connect texts and ideas across time, instead of sticking to one linear path. Together, they made me wonder how much more personal and creative the internet could be if we treated it less like a product and more like an evolving space we can shape.

                        What stood out to me in Lialina’s discussion of Geocities was how the platform both democratized web creation and revealed the limits of digital permanence. The “neighborhoods” and templates she describes gave users structure, but they also reflected the constraints and assumptions built into early internet culture. I found it interesting that the survival of small artifacts like Yahoo!’s clip art or even the invisible “c.gif” carry so much historical weight, reminding us that even trivial design elements can become crucial evidence of digital heritage. It made me think about how today’s platforms, which feel so polished and seamless, might one day be studied through equally small traces.

                        This reading made me think about how different print is from other media like music or video. Ludovico points out that while those formats changed carriers (CDs, MP3s, DVDs), the core experience stayed the same. But with books, the page itself is the experience, so going digital changes the experience a lot more. I thought it was interesting how print is being reimagined as something collectible or special, especially in zine culture. Cramer adds that instead of seeing print and digital as opposites, we’re in a “post-digital” world where the two overlap and mix in creative ways. Overall, these ideas made me think about how hybrid media offers new forms of participation that transcend the old “print vs. digital” binary.

                        The discussion about subjectivity made me think about accessibility through a different lens. Instead of aiming for a false “objectivity,” alt-text writers are encouraged to embrace their perspectives, while still centering the needs of blind and low-vision users. This helped me see how description or alt-text can be a creative practice shaped by voice, tone, and audience, not just a technical requirement.

                        Nasser’s essay shows that programming languages and computer systems—often seen as universal—are actually rooted in English and Western assumptions. His attempt to build the Arabic programming language (Qalb) exposes how bias runs deeper than just syntax, shaping the very infrastructure of software. It brings up the question of what “accessibility” really means in tech: if coding still depends on English, who actually gets to shape the digital world?

                        One point that I thought was interesting from Reinfurt’s reading was his example of looking out a window and perceiving “house, sky, and trees” instead of hundreds of distinct colors. As a psych major, it was nice to see how a familiar concept (Gestalt principle of closure) can be connected to design, showing how our minds naturally simplify and organize information into coherent wholes. This concept ties closely to design, where visual elements are intentionally made to align with how we perceive the world. It’s a good reminder that strong design is grounded as much in people and psychology as it is in aesthetics.

                        I found Duvall’s idea of the “hyperlinked sign” really interesting—the notion that every image or symbol now carries endless layers of meaning, kind of like how links on the internet connect us to different contexts. It shows how design today relies less on clarity and more on shared digital references that not everyone might catch. It made me think about how the internet has changed not just how we design, but how we read design.

                        One part that stuck with me was the idea of String Games creating a “poetics of absence.” I thought it was interesting how Frenkel swapped out an actual string for gestures, words, and sounds, so the whole game became more about what wasn’t there than what was. Even though everyone could see each other through the screens, there were still these little gaps or pauses that made the distance between them super noticeable. It made me think about how early this artwork recognized something we feel constantly today: that digital connection is real, but there’s always a bit of loss built into it.

                        One part that stuck with me was Soulellis’ idea of the feed creating this “new boredom,” where we keep watching not because anything meaningful is happening, but because we know other people are watching too. It made me think about how often I scroll or watch something just for the sake of watching even if the content itself is not inherently interesting. I liked how he described the feed as a “texture,” because it honestly does feel like something I move through instead of something more intentional. It’s interesting to think about how algorithms shape everyone’s feed differently, creating unique “textures” of content, but somehow there’s still a shared feeling of collective participation.

                        I found Groys’ argument interesting that once art moves onto the Internet, it stops functioning as immersive fiction and instead becomes something closer to documentation or an ongoing process. The idea that art now exists alongside everyday information—rather than in a separate, protected space like a museum—made me rethink how we experience creativity online.
